## Agile Methodologies
- **Sprint Planning**: User stories were divided and assigned in sprint meetings.
- **Pair Programming**: Developers collaborated to write and debug code together.
- **TDD**: Test-driven development ensured robust and reliable code.
- **Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews maintained quality and clean code practices.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: XML for layouts, Java for Android development.
- **Back-End**: Firebase Realtime Database for data storage.
- **APIs**:
  - Firebase Authentication
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
  - Google Maps API for location-based features
  - PayPal API for payment processing

## System Architecture
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database structured into nodes for users, job postings, applications, and preferred jobs.
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging topics are used to send updates based on user preferences.
- **Modular Code**: Features are split into distinct modules for better maintainability.

## Challenges
- **Debugging a Large Codebase**: Managing and debugging interconnected features.
- **Integrating APIs**: Ensuring seamless integration of Firebase, Google Maps, and PayPal APIs.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Implementing push notifications for both preferred jobs and application status updates.
